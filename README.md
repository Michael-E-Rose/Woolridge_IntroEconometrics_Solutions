# Woolridge_IntroEconometrics
Python Scripts with solutions for the Computational Exercises in Woolridge's "Introductory Econometrics".  This is the Python equivalent of http://fmwww.bc.edu/GStat/examples/wooldridge/wooldridge.html, which gives solutions in Stata.

We used pandas 1.0.1 and statsmodels 0.11.
